Google Map data can be used to create a dataset of an undirected weighted graph.
This can be represented using an adjacency list.

The code in this repository will allow a user to find the shortest path and the minimum spanning tree in the dataset.

Dijkstra's Algorithm has been used to dertemine the shortest path.
Prim's Eager Algorithm has been used to find the minimum spanning tree.
